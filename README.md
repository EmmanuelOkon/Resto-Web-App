A Food Web App created with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
This is a project I created to further my experience on Vanilla JavaScript, to gain experience on how to make Web Apps functional.
This project is private and was taken from the Youtube Channel, Mr. Web Designer - Complete Responsive Food / Restaurant Website Design Using HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT - From Scratch, Jul 29, 2021.
This project provided free access to the source code where I picked the Developer's assets to reproduce the Developer's example.

With this project, I learned how to introduce Scrollspy effect on any web app.
This project also taught me how to make cards, buttons, and forms fully responsive.
On the Order A Meal Section, I also introduced a feature with makes the textarea undesirable.
This project has also taught me how to properly use carousels, especially on the Customers' Review Section.
